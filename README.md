# Alacpretty ‚ÄéÔ∏è‚Äçüåà

<a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> is a GPU-enhanced terminal emulator; Alacpretty is a Go program that leverages <a href="https://github.com/gizak/termui">termui</a> to provide Alacritty users the ability to edit their Alacritty configurations via a terminal user-interface.

## How it works

Alacpretty components are ready to plug into your Alacritty configurations. Assuming your `alacritty.yml` file is in the appropriate location as specified in the <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty documentation</a>, all you'll need to do is grab the components you need from `internal/ui`, and drop them into <a href="https://github.com/solidiquis/alacpretty/blob/master/internal/ui/widgets_controller.go">WidgetsController</a> like it is done in `cmd/alacpretty/main.go`.

```go
package main

import (
	aui "github.com/solidiquis/alacpretty/internal/ui"
	"github.com/solidiquis/alacpretty/internal/yamlconf"
)

func main() {
  // Reads the contents of alacritty.yml to a string
  content := yamlconf.ReadFileToString()
  
  // Set the position of each widget, and arrange in however
  // many rows you need.
  row1 := []aui.UIWidget{
    aui.NewThemeShuffler(0, 0, 25, 10),
    aui.NewFontsizeAdjuster(26, 0, 51, 10),
  }
  row2 := []aui.UIWidget{
    aui.NewOpacityGauge(0, 11, 51, 14),
  }

  // Controller handles rendering and navigating between widgets.
  aui.WidgetsController(
    &content,
    row1,
    row2,
  )
}
```

Here is how you navigate the UI:
- `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` and `‚Üê`, `‚Üì`, `‚Üë` , `‚Üí` are equivalent and are used to navigate inside the widget or change its appearance.
- `H`, `J`, `K`, `L` are used to navigate across widgets, as only one can be focused on at a time.

They way in which the focus shifts between widgets is dependent upon the way you arrange your widgets in rows.

## How to use

There are a couple ways in which you can use Alacpretty: The simplest way would be to have Go installed, clone this repo, and run `go run cmd/alacpretty/main.go` - or you can clone this repo, compile the code into binary, and stick it somewhere in your path.
